# MNIST Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It also includes an example of using the trained model for inference on a single image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:


2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

cd mnist-cnn

3. Run the training script:


This will display the image along with the predicted class probabilities.

## Credits

This code is based on the MNIST classification tutorial provided in the PyTorch documentation.
