# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The implementation is done using Python and TensorFlow.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

2. Evaluate the model:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

3. Predict using the trained model:

```bash
python predict.py <path_to_image>
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is a grayscale image with a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

The dataset is automatically downloaded and preprocessed during training.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). It consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The final layer uses softmax activation to output the probabilities of each digit class.

The architecture details can be found in the `model.py` file.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 99% on the test dataset.
